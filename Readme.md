<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

 The `RideChain` project represents a significant step forward in the evolution of the ride-sharing industry. By leveraging blockchain technology and a decentralized platform, Ride-Chain aims to create a more secure, transparent, and efficient ride-sharing system that benefits both riders and drivers.

## Features:
* ### Decentralized ride-sharing:
    The platform connects fellow commuters without the need for intermediaries. Users can search for and join existing ride-sharing groups or create their own ride-sharing groups. Users can also search for rides and request to join a group. The platform ensures that all rides are safe and secure by verifying driver and passenger identities.

* ### Smart contracts:
    Smart contracts are used to enforce ride-sharing rules and regulations, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and secure.

* ### Client-side interaction using MetaMask:
    MetaMask is a web3 wallet that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and other networks directly from their web browsers. It seamlessly integrates with popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc making transactions user-friendly. Being a transaction media, it provides a highly secure way to manage digital transactions.

* ### User-friendly interface: 

    The platform has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that makes it simple for drivers and passengers to interact.
    Registration and Profile Creation: 
    Users can create an account on the platform by providing their personal information and creating a profile. The platform ensures that all user data is secure and protected.

* ### Data Handling using IPFS: 
    InterPlanetary File System is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that aims to create a permanent and decentralized method for storing and sharing files.
    It uses a distributed network of nodes to store and retrieve files. For our RideChain project, it holds all the more relevance to safekeep commuter data.
    It also supports a content-addressed system, where files are identified by their content rather than by their location or name. Thus, the possibility of attacks on remote servers would be rendered useless.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The requisite dependencies to run the backend is listed in package.json file that can be installed using the command `npm install --force`.
For installing requisites for Django Websocket backend, type command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in respective folder.
For running the frontend, type command `npm start` in the frontend folder and for backend, type `python manage.py runserver` in backend folder.

### Matching Algorithm

* The user can add a source and a destination point, which can be selected both by clicking on the map as well as selecting from the drop down menu. The map displays the shortest path using the distance formula in the backend.

### Use of IPFS for decentralized storage
